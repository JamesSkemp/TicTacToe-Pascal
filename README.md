JRSs Tic-Tac-Toe
================

JRSs Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe programmed with Dev-Pascal. It even keeps a tally of your points (win = +1, loss = -1).

Current limitations:

	Runs in MS-DOS, and therefore lacks an interface of sorts
	Again, lacks a pretty interface ;)
	You can only play versus the computer.  I would like to create a two player option at some point in the future.

Comments regarding this program are greatly appreciated. Thank you for using and testing my program.
